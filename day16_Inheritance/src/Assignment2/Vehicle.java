/*
Create a base class called Vehicle that has

the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String),
number of cylinders in the engine (type int),
 and owner (type Person given in Lesson).

  Then create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has additional properties:
the load capacity in tons (type double, since it may contain a fractional part)
and towing capacity in tons (type double).
 Give your classes a reasonable complement of constructors and accessor methods.

 Write a driver program that tests all your methods.
