/*

An employee record inherits an employeeâ€™s name
from the class Person.
In addition, an employee record contains an annual salary
represented as a single value of type double,
a hire date that gives the year hired as a single value of type int,
 and an identification number that is a value of type String.
 Give your class a reasonable complement of constructors,
 accessor methods, and mutator methods.
Write a program to fully test your class definition.
